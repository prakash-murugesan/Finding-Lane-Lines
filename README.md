# Finding-Lane-Lines 


This project is set up to optimize paramaters of canny edge detection and hough transforms to identify lane lines on the road 
Following which, the lane lines were then averaged and extrapolated over the narrowed field of view to produce extended solid lane lines. 

Finally, this pipeline is used for a series of images, or better known as a video, of a car driving down a road.
